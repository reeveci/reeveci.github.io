# Cron

Some features of Reeve make use of Cron expressions for scheduling periodically occuring events.

A Cron expression consists of 5 fields, each for a different interval of time:

```
*     *     *     *     *

^     ^     ^     ^     ^
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     +----- day of week (0-6) (Sunday=0)
|     |     |     +------- month (1-12)
|     |     +--------- day of month (1-31)
|     +----------- hour (0-23)
+------------- min (0-59)
```

## Examples

- `* * * * *` run on every minute
- `10 * * * *` run at 0:10, 1:10 etc
- `10 15 * * *` run at 15:10 every day
- `* * 1 * *` run on every minute on 1st day of month
- `0 0 1 1 *` Happy new year schedule

## Lists

- `1-15 * * * *` run at 1, 2, 3...15 minute of each hour
- `0 0-5,10 * * *` run on every hour from 0-5 and in 10 oclock

## Steps
